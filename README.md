Visualize your ancestry

This is a project that I have been meaning to do since a while. I really like tracing back my ancestry and adding members of my family both close and extended to websites like facestree.com to visualize relationships. The problems with such websites are that they are fairly static.

My idea is to make a simple tool that can do the following

- Add members of a family, each family member can enter details such as name, dob, place of birth, death, date of death and any notes that needs to be added for the member
- Visualize the tree interactively in 3d, I can move and scroll around the tree and get more info by clicking on the tree node
- No limit on the number of family members that can be added
